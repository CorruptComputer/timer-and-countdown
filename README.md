# Timer and Countdown

This webapp was created for me to learn React. The site can be reached at [https://nickolas.gupton.xyz/timer-and-countdown/](https://nickolas.gupton.xyz/timer-and-countdown/).

## Building

To build you will first need to run `npm install`, afterwards please see the "Running" section below:

### Running

To run you'll need to do `npm start` in your terminal.

This will the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

`npm run build` will build the app for production into the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
The app will ready to be deployed after this command!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
